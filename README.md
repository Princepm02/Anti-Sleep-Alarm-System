# Anti Sleep Alarm System: Stay Awake and Alert!

This project builds an anti-sleep alarm system integrated into eye glasses for real-time drowsiness detection and prevention.

## Project Description

Imagine wearing a pair of eyeglasses that keeps you alert and focused throughout the day. Our Anti-Sleep Alarm System does just that! The system seamlessly integrates with your vision, monitoring your eye blinks and triggering gentle yet effective alerts when you're showing signs of drowsiness or fatigue.

## Key Features

- **Drowsiness Detection:** The system uses an eye blink sensor to detect extended eye closure (over 1.5 seconds), indicating potential sleepiness.
- **Multi-Modal Alerting:** Upon detecting drowsiness, the system activates two alert mechanisms:
  - Passive Buzzer: Emits a gentle but noticeable sound to break through drowsiness.
  - Coin Vibration Motor: Provides haptic feedback through vibrations on the temple area, offering a discreet and effective wake-up call.
- **Lightweight and Comfortable:** The system is designed to be worn comfortably on your existing eyeglasses, ensuring minimal disruption to your daily activities.

### How It Works

The eye glasses are worn by the user, and the eye blink sensor continuously monitors for signs of drowsiness. If the sensor detects the user closing their eyes for more than 1.5 seconds, the system is triggered. This leads to the activation of the passive buzzer, emitting an audible alert, and the coin vibration motor starts vibrating, providing haptic feedback to wake up the user.

## Components Used

- **Eye Blink Sensor:** Monitors the user's eye activity.
- **Arduino Nano:** Controls the system and processes sensor data.
- **Passive Buzzer:** Emits an audible alert when fatigue is detected.
- **Coin Vibration Motor:** Provides haptic feedback to wake up the user.
- **SPST Switch:** Enables easy on/off functionality.
- **Jumper Wires:** Connects components according to the circuit diagram.
- **9V Battery:** Powers the system.

## How to Use

1. Assemble the components on the eyeglass frame as per the circuit diagram.
2. Wear the glasses with the integrated system.
3. Power on the system using the SPST switch.
4. The system will monitor for signs of drowsiness and activate the alert mechanisms when needed.
